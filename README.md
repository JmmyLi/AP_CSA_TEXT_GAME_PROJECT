This is a project for AP Computer Science A
## Intro
>You are trapped in an enchanted space. The only thing with you is your empty bag, and your goal is to escape from this weird place. You need to solve puzzles and get pieces of information and props that can help you to escape from this space. 

## Tutorial
>You need to navigate this place by typing commands, and you can get your status, open your bag, or open map with areas you have already passed at any time. In addition, you can interact with things on the place you are at, and get props on the ground.

The only character is you, a very smart time traveler.
